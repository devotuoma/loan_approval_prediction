Loan Approval Predictor - Complete Implementation with Detailed Documentation

Project Description

This project develops a machine learning system to predict loan approval decisions based on applicant information. The system automates the loan screening process by analyzing patterns in historical loan data and building predictive models that can assist financial institutions in making consistent, data-driven lending decisions.
