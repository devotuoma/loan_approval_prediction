Loan Approval Predictor - Complete Implementation with Detailed Documentation

Project Description

This project develops a machine learning system to predict loan approval decisions based on applicant information. The system automates the loan screening process by analyzing patterns in historical loan data and building predictive models that can assist financial institutions in making consistent, data-driven lending decisions.

1. Project Setup and Data Loading
Description
This initial stage establishes the foundation for the machine learning pipeline by setting up the development environment, importing essential libraries, and loading the loan dataset.

Key Activities

Import required libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning

Load the loan training dataset (614 rows × 13 columns)

Perform initial data inspection

Identify missing values in 7 columns

Expected Outcomes

Successfully loaded dataset with full structural understanding

Preliminary data quality assessment

Identification of missing values for preprocessing

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Description
Comprehensive data exploration to uncover patterns, relationships, and feature behaviors to guide modeling strategy and feature engineering.

Key Findings

Target Distribution: 68.7% approved, 31.3% rejected

Critical Factor: Credit history shows 96% vs 8% approval rate difference

Property Area Impact:

Semiurban: 76.8% approval

Urban: 65.8% approval

Rural: 61.5% approval

Education Influence:

Graduates: 70.8% approval

Non-graduates: 61.2% approval

Analysis Components

Target variable distribution analysis

Relationships between categorical features and loan status

Distributions and correlations of numerical features

Advanced insights into feature-target relationships

3. Data Preprocessing
Description
Systematic transformation of raw data into a clean, machine-learning-ready format via cleaning, imputation, and feature engineering.

Preprocessing Pipeline
Missing Value Treatment

Categorical Variables: Mode imputation

Numerical Variables: Median imputation

Final Result: No missing values in the dataset

Feature Engineering
Created six new derived features:

Total_Income: Combined household income

Income_to_Loan_Ratio: Debt-to-income indicator

Has_Coapplicant: Binary flag for joint applications

Income_Category: Segmented income levels

Loan_Category: Segmented loan amounts

Term_Category: Loan duration segments

Categorical Encoding

Method: Label Encoding (for 8 categorical variables)

Rationale: Memory-efficient and compatible with tree-based models

Final Dataset

Shape: 614 rows × 14 features

Quality: Complete data with no missing values

Enhancement: Engineered features improved predictive power

4. Model Development
Description
Training of two machine learning models: Logistic Regression and Decision Tree, with validation and hyperparameter optimization.

Model Architecture
Logistic Regression

Algorithm: L2-regularized logistic regression

Preprocessing: StandardScaler normalization

Hyperparameters: C = 1.0, max_iter = 1000

Decision Tree

Algorithm: CART

Hyperparameters: max_depth = 10, min_samples_split = 20

Pruning: Applied to avoid overfitting

Training Configuration

Training Set: 80% (491 samples)

Test Set: 20% (123 samples)

Validation: 5-fold cross-validation with stratification

Cross-Validation Results

Logistic Regression: 79.43% ± 3.66%

Decision Tree: 74.54% ± 5.52%
