Loan Approval Predictor - Complete Implementation with Detailed Documentation

Project Description

This project develops a machine learning system to predict loan approval decisions based on applicant information. The system automates the loan screening process by analyzing patterns in historical loan data and building predictive models that can assist financial institutions in making consistent, data-driven lending decisions.

Dataset
The dataset (Loan_Train.csv) contains 614 samples with 13 features including:

Loan_ID: Unique loan ID

Gender: Applicant's gender

Married: Marital status

Dependents: Number of dependents

Education: Education level

Self_Employed: Self-employment status

ApplicantIncome: Applicant's income

CoapplicantIncome: Co-applicant's income

LoanAmount: Loan amount in thousands

Loan_Amount_Term: Term of loan in months

Credit_History: Credit history meets guidelines

Property_Area: Urban/Semi-Urban/Rural

Loan_Status: Loan approved (Y/N) - Target variable

Key Findings from EDA
The dataset shows a class imbalance with 68.7% loans approved and 31.3% rejected

Important relationships were found between loan approval and:

Credit history

Applicant income

Property area

Education level

Several features contain missing values that need to be handled

Models Implemented
The notebook implements and compares two classification models:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Model performance is evaluated using:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-score

ROC-AUC score

Confusion matrix

Requirements
To run this notebook, you'll need:

Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Usage
Clone the repository

Install required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt

Open the Jupyter notebook: jupyter notebook Loan_Approval_Prediction.ipynb

Run all cells to reproduce the analysis

Future Improvements
Handle class imbalance using techniques like SMOTE

Experiment with more advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost)

Perform hyperparameter tuning

Deploy the model as a web application
